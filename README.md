# Melanoma detection using CNN
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis

## General Information
- This project is about a solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- In the base CNN model, the traing accuracy and validation accuracy are almost same, but very low which indicates that the model is underfitting
- In the augmented model, there is a sign of good fit but the accuracy is still very low.
- In the class rebalanced model, The validation accuracy is very good and there are no signs of over/under fittng
- This class rebalanced model is the ideal model for Melanoma cancer detection
